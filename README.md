REACT

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is the view layer for web applications.

At the heart of all React applications are components. A component is a self-contained module that renders some output. We can write interface elements like a button or an input field as a React component. Components are composable. A component might include one or more other components in its output.

Broadly speaking, to write React apps we write React components that correspond to various interface elements. We then organize these components inside higher-level components which define the structure of our application.

For example, take a form. A form might consist of many interface elements, like input fields, labels, or buttons. Each element inside the form can be written as a React component. We'd then write a higher-level component, the form component itself. The form component would specify the structure of the form and include each of these interface elements inside of it.

Importantly, each component in a React app abides by strict data management principles. Complex, interactive user interfaces often involve complex data and application state. The surface area of React is limited and aimed at giving us the tools to be able to anticipate how our application will look with a given set of circumstances. 

STRENGTHS OF REACT:
1. Simpler code with fewer bugs
2. React is blazingly fast
3. It plays nicely with your existing code
4. Learn once, write anywhere
5. Reactive community is always willing to help



Prototype

Pharmacy management system aims at providing a simpler management system to the pharmacy owners. The idea behind was to create a simpler management system for pharmacy owners in Asia where every pharmacy owner runs their business individually. The system will show the sale record of the pharmacy and will help the owners to maintain their stock.The idea behind the approach was to use the data from sales in pharmacy to manage their stocks, profit/loss and also to see the sale trends of different medicines. The record will help the shop owners to manage their business and will also show the different pattern in sales of medicines in different regions. The sales pattern of different medicines will help to predict the health problem and also to see what type of medicine people prefer when multiple options are available in the market.React will be used to build the interface of the prototype.We will be using rect to make data visualisation more interactive so that it is easy for the user to get and idea about their stocks and business.The data regarding the sales for aparticular medicine will be our main focus.To show that which medicine has the highest sales in comparison to similar medicines for the same purpose.
